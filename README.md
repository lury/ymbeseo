Fork of Yoast SEO 2.3.5 - remove all the bloat

## Description


## Frequently Asked Questions


## Contributions

Although the aim is to completely go back to the basics, the original Yoast SEO plugin is massive, so we could use a hand! The first goal is to clean up all the references to Yoast SEO, wordpress-seo and/or wpseo. Once that has been done we will first focus on the obvious, basically everything that the [SO Clean Up Yoast SEO plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/so-clean-up-wp-seo/) addresses, but this time not simply in a `display: none;` way, but instead removing the entire functionality.
By that time we hope that we have a few contributors, so we can start making a list of features that will have to go and features that can stay.
